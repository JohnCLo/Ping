iOS, Android App built on Ionic with Node.js and MongoDB on the Backend.<br/><br/>

Ping allows users to post geotagged stories and for other users to "find" stories when within an approximate distance. Ping allows for more immersive storytelling and aims to create greater empathy for first person annecdotes by connecting a physical environment to the experience.
